! DOE Commercial Building Benchmark
! Secondary school, new construction
! Benchmark V 1.1_3.1
! EnergyPlus V 3.1
! ASHRAE Standards 90.1-2004 and 62-1999
!
! Description:  Two story, secondary school, 46 zones
!               Classrooms, auditorium, gymnasium, cafeteria, kitchen
!               Original model developed for the K-12 Advanced Energy Design Guide
! Form:         Area = 23,804 m2 (210,886 ft2); Number of Stories = 2; Shape = "E",
!               Main corridor with three wings for class rooms
! Envelope:     Envelope thermal properties vary with climate according to ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004.
!               Opaque constructions: steel frame walls; built up flat roof; slab-on-grade floor
!               Windows: window-to-wall ratio = 34%,
!               Skylights: 4% roof area in gymnasium and auxilary gymnasium
!               Infiltration in perimeter zones only
!                            = 0.4 cfm/ft2 above grade wall area at 0.3 in wc (75 Pa) adjusted to 0.016 in wc (4 Pa).
!                              25% of full value when ventilation system on.
! HVAC:         Air-cooled chiller, boiler, MZ-VAV with reheat in most of the building;
!               PSZ-AC and gas furnace in gymnasium, auditorium, kitchen, and cafeteria
!               Economizer per 90.1-2004
! Exhaust:      restroom exhaust = 600 L/s total (1200 cfm); Kitchen exhaust 2832 L/s (6000 cfm), make up air from cafeteria
!               Kitchen exhaust fan modeled as an external load to avoid getting double the make-up air
! Refrigeration: Walk-in cooler and walk-in freezer
! Elevators:    2 @ 14.6 kW each
!
